# First, we need to configure the Octez node to run in sandbox mode:

octez-node config init --network "sandbox" --rpc-addr localhost --connections 0

# The --rpc-addr option sets the TCP address for reaching the RPC server instance. 
# The --connections option removes the requirement for establishing connections with other nodes.
# Then, we generate the identity of the node we want to run:

octez-node identity generate 0

# To start the newly configured node in the background, you will need:

nohup octez-node run --synchronisation-threshold 0 --network "sandbox" > node.log &

# The --synchronisation-threshold option specifies the number of peers required to complete chain synchronization 
# for bootstrapping the node. In our case, since there are no other nodes, this value is set to 0. 
# Essentially, you have created a network consisting of a single node.

# To use the octez-client command, we need to wait for the node to get bootstrapped:

while ! octez-client bootstrapped; do sleep 1; done

# When bootstrapping a new network, it is initialized with a placeholder economic protocol known as the "genesis" 
# protocol. Our goal is to upgrade the network's economic protocol to the alpha version, enabling us to originate a Smart 
# Rollup. To accomplish this, we must first create an account and use its key to activate the new protocol:

octez-client import secret key activator unencrypted:edsk31vznjHSSpGExDMHYASz45VZqXN4DPxvsa4hAyY8dHM28cZzp6

# To execute the activation command, we require sandbox parameters that are essentially modified versions of the 
# Mainnet parameters tailored for testing purposes. The purpose of these adjustments is to create the testing phase, 
# as we do not want operations to take an excessive amount of time. It is important to note that these optimizations 
# may not reflect the performance on the actual Mainnet. The necessary data for this can be found in the 
# `sandbox-parameters.json` file.

octez-client -block genesis activate protocol ProtoALphaALphaALphaALphaALphaALphaALphaALphaDdp3zK with fitness 1 and key activator and parameters ./params.json
# The migration to the alpha protocol requires a manual baking process. In this case, we will create new test accounts 
# to facilitate this process.
